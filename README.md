# Hi there 👋, I'm Abdul Rafeh

## About Me
I'm a **Java Developer** with a focus on **backend development** using **Spring Boot**. I have a deep passion for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable systems. I'm constantly exploring new technologies, and my goal is to build high-quality solutions that solve real-world problems.

🔭 I’m currently working on:
- Building **RESTful APIs** with **Spring Boot** and **Hibernate**.
- Contributing to **open-source** projects related to **backend systems**.

🌱 I’m always learning:
- Currently diving deep into **microservices architecture** and **cloud platforms** (AWS, Azure).
- Learning **containerization** with **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.
